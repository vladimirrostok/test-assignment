# App directory

App directory is meant to store the actual application code there while rest of the stuff can be placed in the root monorepo directory.

As for example, there might be different programming directories (Go/Python/etc) and a common docker-compose file that will manage the /Go and /Python and /Postgres services altogether.

It's a great place to store the Docker-compose and Kubernetes configuration files.
